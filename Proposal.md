# Smart Parking System #

**Every day we note the increasing of numbers of cars that require more parking places. In this project we are going to develop a new parking system which called “Smart Parking System” is proposed to help drivers to find vacant spots inside a parking lot. By using ultrasound sensors, the system will be able to figure out and specify the unoccupied spots.**
