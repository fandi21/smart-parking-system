# 1.0- Business Objectives for Process: #
**Parking lot is significant in these days to all drivers especially in those crowded cities such as New York City. By providing Smart Parking System in those cities, we are going to help drivers getting their parking easily, saving time, and money.**

# 2.0- Business Requirements: #
**It is normal to have parking lot, yet it is necessary to have Smart Parking System. In our project we will provide several helpful things for customers to make their life easy. Drivers need to reserve their spots online or by using a smart phone. If they are front of Smart Parking System, they just need to see a board that shows vacant spots even before they get in.**

## 2.3 Business Impact ##
The system will increase the amount of customer.  The system will be decrease a time to find space in the garage.  The customer can use the system to reservation space before he or she come.

### 2.3.1 Metrics to Measure Business Impact ###

#### 2.3.1.1 Measurable Business Metrics to be Used ####
  * Are there number at every space in garage?
  * How many screen in each floor?

#### 2.3.1.2 Responsibility of Metrics Collection & Analysis ####
  * The numbers of customer use the system to make reservation.
  * The numbers of customer who follow the instructions( the light in every space or the screen in each floor).
  * The numbers of customer who stop his car in tow space.

#### 2.3.1.3 Business / System Metrics Communication Plan ####
  * The Manger for the garage.
  * The operator.

### 2.3.2 Business Dependencies ###
This project is dependent upon the program area being able to allocate a full time functional lead by May.

### 2.3.3 Business Risks ###
If same customer reservation space, but when he arrive to that space, he find another car in that space.

## 2.4 Technology Impact ##
  * The customer will know if there is space available before he enter to a floor.
  * The operator will know if some car stop in tow space.

### 2.4.1 Technology Dependencies ###
The reservation system will be work by the garage website and the garage application in smart phone after month from begins the system.

### 2.4.2 Technology Risks ###
  * Broken any sensor, screen or space light.
  * The reservation system stop work for any reason or show wrong data.

# 3.0- Assumptions: #
  * Every customer should see the screen in each floor and see the lights in each spot.

  * The customers have to only park their cars in appropriate spots.

# 4.0- Issues: #
  * If a customer does not stop well in a spot or stop between two spots, the operator will receive notice from the system then the customer is going to be charged.
  * If another customer stops at a reserved spot accidentally.

# 5.0- Project Success Criteria: #
  * The most important point is the system have to be completed by the end of this semester May 2013.
  * The system should be handed and easily to use for everyone.
  * The cost of the system should be as low as possible.
